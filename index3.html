		<h2 class = "regular"><a id = "boreal"></a>Boreal Shield</h2>
		<p class = "reg">The Boreal Shield is widely considered to be the most picturesque area of Canada. Across the Boreal Shield, there are huge expanses of flat plains stretching 
		as far as the eye can see (mostly in Saskatchewan and Manitoba). Not only are there plains, there are also gently rolling hills as well! And if you love sailing boats or 
		swimming, you&#39;re in luck! There are dozens of lakes and rivers all over the Boreal Shield! In fact, all of these lakes and rivers account for 22% of Canada&#39;s freshwater 
		surface area!</p>

		<h2 class = "regular"><a id = "boreal"></a>Ottawa</h2>
		<p class = "reg">If you like big-city luxury, this is the ideal place to go! Ottawa is much larger than most cities in Canada with a population over 1 million! All of these 
		people contribute to an ecstatic environment that is hard to ignore. Ottawa has a total area of 2,778 square kilometers. Being a lowland, most of Ottawa is characterized by 
		flat plains with glacial hills and deep river valleys. Ottawa is such an amazing city that they have their own council made to “beautify” the city (called “National Capital 
		Commission (NCC)”).</p>

		<h2 class = "regular"><a id = "boreal"></a>St. John&#39;s</h2>
		<p class = "reg">This magnificent city is actually an island carved on rock! Can you believe that!? St. John&#39;s covers a total area of 446 squared kilometres with around 
		205,955 people living there. This small population gives the city a small-town vibe. Many Canadians and out-of-country visitors, alike, love to stay in St. John&#39;s just to 
		relax and enjoy the peace. The downtown area of St. John&#39;s is known for its steep hills and curving streets. However, the coastline is quite the opposite. The landscape is 
		relatively rough, with numerous cliffs from which you can see and hear the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
